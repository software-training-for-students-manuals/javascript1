WELCOME USER! You've reached the source code for a manual created by STS. If you plan on updating or editing this manual, then you're in the right place!

Before editing this manual, please read through the manual editing guide at https://sts.doit.wisc.edu/manuals/manual-editing-guide/ and follow its recommendations. It is important that we adhere to the conventions set in the guide in order to maintain quality and consistency across all manuals.

A few things to note:

* In order to have a working preview with accurate CSS and functional JavaScript, you will need a copy of the /master-files folder in the same parent directory as the folder with your manual editing files in it, e.g. if you have a folder on your desktop "STS Manuals", and you're editing the Excel 1 manual in the "excel1" folder and the Photoshop 1 folder in the "photoshop1" folder, you will need to have the "master-files" folder in "STS Manuals" as well, since the manual files link to the CSS/Javascript using relative links. Your folder will look like this: 

├STS Manuals 
├╴╴excel1
├╴╴╴╴╴images
├╴╴╴╴╴class_files
├╴╴master-files
├╴╴photoshop1
├╴╴╴╴╴images
├╴╴╴╴╴class_files


* Manuals should be arranged into Topics, which are enclosed in the <section class="topic"> tag, and followed immediately by an <h1> tag with the topic name in it, e.g.

<section class="topic">
<h1>Topic name</h1>
<p>Neat and helpful information goes here</p>
</section>

The <section class="topic"> and following <h1> element are how the manual's JavaScript automagically builds the Topics outline and creates the links, so if they are not there, the manual will be without a table of contents and its friends will probably make fun of it (which is decidedly not cool).

* Unless you are changing the contents of the <title></title> tag, you should not have to touch the <head> portion of this document (unless instructed to do so). This tag connects the HTML to the CSS and JavaScript that keep the manual functioning. Look for the comment tag that says "MAIN CONTENT", and you may edit there.


Good luck, and have fun!

                <h2 id="Introduction_About this Class">About this Class</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is used as a client-side scripting language on many of today's most popular web sites. It
                    may also be used as a server side programming language using a framework like Node.js. JavaScript
                    extends the basic functionality of HTML and CSS to provide interactive features on a web page. In
                    this class, you will learn the basics of JavaScript by completing some small projects.</p>
                <h2 id="Introduction_Topics">Topics</h2>
                <p>This workshop will cover the following topics:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <h2 id="Introduction_Required Skills">Required Skills</h2>
                <p>Since JavaScript is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS, this class requires <strong>moderate
                        experience with HTML</strong> and <strong>basic experience with CSS</strong>. If you have taken
                    the <strong>HTML 1</strong> and <strong>CSS 1</strong> classes offered by Software Training for
                    Students, you should meet these requirements.</p>
                <p>Also, familiarity with a programming language or scripting in general is helpful, but not required
                    for this course. JavaScript uses many of the same control structures as other programming languages
                    (PHP, Java, C, C++, etc.) and scripting languages (BASH, etc.), but this will not be a focus of this
                    class.</p>
                <h2 id="Introduction_Other Requirements">Required Software</h2>
                <p>We recommend that you use Google Chrome as a web browser, because it has a proper JavaScript console
                    that we can run JavaScript statements in. Other browsers have similar developer tools, but for this
                    class we will use Chrome.</p>
                <p>You will also need a text editor to create JavaScript files, and view the HTML and CSS behind our web
                    site. Example text editors for Mac are Sublime Text 2, TextWrangler, or the default text editor,
                    TextEdit. Example text editors for Windows are SciTE, Notepad++, or the default text editor,
                    Notepad. If you can, use a text editor that has syntax highlighting. It will highlight your code for
                    you, and can make fixing errors a lot easier.</p>
                <p>Pre-made files will be given to you, but if you are working on your own, feel free to navigate to the
                    STS website to download the most recent class files.</p>
                <h2 id="Introduction_Accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
                <p>When designing web pages, it is crucial to make pages accessible; that is, viewable by the broadest
                    audience possible. The University of Wisconsin has enacted a <a
                        href="https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web
                        accessibility policy</a> that provides guidelines on how web pages should be written so all
                    users can access them.</p>
                <p>The standard being used is the US Federal Government Standard Section 508. This standard provides a
                    set of rules that, when followed, allow all users to access a web page. The rules are not difficult
                    or intrusive, and obeying them from the start is the easiest way to make accessible pages.</p>
                <p>This policy applies to all University programs and web pages posted on University servers. If you are
                    writing pages for any University site, they must meet this standard. Even if you aren't required to
                    meet this standard, you might want to consider it practice and can help to broaden your audience.

            <section class="topic">
                <h1 class="no-top-margin" id="Introduction to JavaScript">Intro to JavaScript</h1>
                <p>Today, we will be using JavaScript as a client-side scripting language to provide more interactive
                    features on a web page. Client-side means that the JavaScript commands are run by the web browser on
                    the user's (client's) computer. This differs from server-side scripting languages (such as PHP), in
                    which the commands are executed by the web server before the web pages are transferred to the user.
                    Although JavaScript can be used as a server-side programming language, we will only be using it as a
                    client-side scripting language in this class.</p>
                <!-- <h2 id="Introduction to JavaScript_JavaScript History">JavaScript History</h2>
            <p>What we know of today as JavaScript was originally written for the Netscape Navigator web browser in the early 1990's under the name LiveScript. It was rebranded in 1995 with the present name after a deal with Sun Microsystems to also include the Java runtime environment with the Netscape Navigator v2.0 browser.</p>
            <p>Although JavaScript sounds similar to Java, the two are unrelated, except for some common syntax inherited from the C programming languages. Java is a full-fledged object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which could take an entire semester class to learn (See Computer Science 302). JavaScript is very simplified for ease of use, meaning you should be able to become proficient in basic statements after this two-hour class.</p>
            <p>Since JavaScript is licensed to the Netscape family of browsers (including Mozilla Firefox among others), Microsoft actually uses a different language, called JScript to implement JavaScript features. There are a few differences between JavaScript and JScript, but in this class, we will consider both as the same.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is weakly-typed, meaning that declaration of specific variable types is not necessary, but rather it is "figured out" by the context of a variable assignment. JavaScript is also a prototype-based language, which means that instead of pure classes (as in object-oriented programming languages) there are structures called prototypes that allow for customized objects. We will cover more on these concepts later in the class.</p> -->
                <h2 id="Introduction to JavaScript_Client-Side Scripting">Client-Side Scripting</h2>
                <p>Because JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, the code to be processed is run on the user's
                    (client's) computer. This means that it is impossible to "hide" or protect JavaScript code, as it
                    must be readable by the user's computer to run (just as it is impossible to hide HTML or CSS). By
                    running code locally, it can be much faster to respond to user input, for example in form
                    validation, mouse movement, or graphical effects.</p>
                <p>JavaScript also has limited rights, including restricting the modification of local files. In
                    practical JavaScript use, you will be limited to modifying the appearance of the current web page
                    only. Any more complex interactions with a computer file system will likely require server-side
                    programming languages, such as PHP.</p>
                <p>Even with its limited rights, there are still several security risks involving JavaScript, most of
                    which related to out-of-date web browsers. To completely protect a computer from malicious attacks,
                    it is often recommended to disable JavaScript. This adds a new level of complexity for web design -
                    web pages should only JavaScript only for extra features. For this reason, we must obey the
                    following guideline:</p>
                <p><strong>Your web page should be fully usable even if JavaScript is disabled to be completely
                        accessible.</strong></p>
                <p>For this reason, it is often imperative to use JavaScript in conjunction with a server-side
                    programming languages for form validation and good web authoring practices in all other cases.</p>
                <h2 id="Introduction to JavaScript_Uses of JavaScript">Uses of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a prevalent part of current web design practices. Many features of web pages that
                    change based on user input are the result of JavaScript code. Here are a few examples:</p>
                <h3>Lightbox</h3>
                <p>The original lightbox script (<a
                        href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/</a>)
                    displays images in an interactive way, giving the effect of the image floating above the page. Try
                    navigating to the link above, and scrolling down to the "Examples" section. Click on an image in
                    this section to view it.</p>
                <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/usesofjavascript-lightbox-1.png"
                        alt="The Golden Gate bridge, showing the use of a lightbox for interactivity"> </div>
                <div class="sidebar-note">
                    <h2>jQuery</h2>
                    <p>Parallax, and many of these other examples can be easily used in a webpage using a JavaScript
                        library called jQuery. You will learn more about jQuery in our JavaScript 2 class.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Parallax</h3>
                <p>You can use JavaScript to make scrolling through a web page a unique experience. Parallax scrolling
                    is the idea of having the content of your web page scroll faster, or slower, than other elements on
                    your page. Dave Gamache has a nice web page that uses parallax (<a
                        href="http://davegamache.com/parallax/">http://davegamache.com/parallax/</a>).</p>
                <div class="centered-image-large"> <img src="images/usesofjavascript-parallax-1.png"
                        alt="A forest scene showing elements moving via Javascript"> </div>
                <h3>Full Screen Forms</h3>
                <p>JavaScript can be used to make filling out forms a simple experience on your web page, by using full
                    screen HTML forms. Full screen forms are used in a demo shown below. (<a
                        href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/07/30/fullscreen-form-interface/">https://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/07/30/fullscreen-form-interface/</a>).
                </p>
                <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/usesofjavascript-fullscreenforms-1.png"
                        alt="Screenshot of a full-screen form created with Javascript"> </div>
                <p>Although we will only reach the very basics of these effects in this class, check out the JavaScript
                    2 class for more practical examples of these JavaScript effects and more.</p>

                <h2 id="JavaScript Basics_Console Log">Console Logging</h2>
                <p>The "Hello World" program is usually the first program someone writes when learning a new programming
                    language. Essentially, it is a way to learn how to print something to the screen in that particular
                    language. In JavaScript, there's more than one way to do this. The first and the easiest way is
                    printing to the cosole.</p>
                <h3>Logging to the console</h3>
                <div class="sidebar-note">
                    <h2>Console</h2>
                    <p>Most browsers have some sort of JavaScript console. The command console.log() is common, and can
                        be very helpful to track what your script is doing as it runs in the browser.</p>
                </div>

                    <li>
                        <p>Open the class file folder named "Basics" inside of the "JS1_ClassFiles" folder. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Open the "index.html" file in a browser window. It should just be a blank HTML page with the
                            text "Welcome to JavaScript1 with STS!" </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now open the console in the browser. If you are on a Mac, Use the shortcut:
                            <strong>command-option-J</strong>. If you are on Windows, Use the shortcut:
                            <strong>control-shift-J</strong>. Alternatively, you can Navigate to <strong>View &gt;
                                Developer &gt; JavaScript Console</strong>.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The console should currently be empty. To print something to the console, open the "basic.js"
                            file in the "Basics" folder by right clicking on the file and opening in the text editor of
                            your choice.</p>

                        <p>The console.log() method takes a string-type or number-type argument (between the
                            parentheses) and writes it to the console. You can either use single quotation marks (') or
                            double quotation marks (") to specify a string of text. Whatever you use, just be sure to
                            stay consistent. If you are writing a number to the console, do not use quotation marks.

                <p>We can use the JavaScript console in Google Chrome to write and execute JavaScript statements "on the
                    fly". Next, we will learn about some simple statements we can execute in JavaScript. Using the
                    console to practice these statements is recommended, because it eliminates the issues you might run
                    into saving and refreshing an internal script in your HTML code.</p>

                    This is perfectly normal. Leave the JavaScript console open, and do not refresh your web page for

                <div class="sidebar-note">
                    <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
                    <p>Always put the "let" keyword in your variable declarations. This will reduce errors in your code.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>A variable can be thought of as a box that contains some sort of information. For example, you could
                    look inside the box and see what's inside, or you could change what is stored in the box. In
                    JavaScript, you should think of a variable as a box that holds a value. If you decide to store
                    something into a variable, this process is called "assigning" a variable. It would be similar to
                    storing something into an empty box. If you have the name of a variable, you can easily read the
                    value stored in that variable by simply using the name wherever you need the value.</p>
                <p>In JavaScript we can declare variables using the following syntax,</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> variableName;</code></pre>
                <p>where "let" is a special keyword that denotes a variable, and "variableName" is whatever you choose
                    to name the variable. There are some restrictions as to what you can name your variables. Good
                    reference for this information and reference for JavaScript in general can be found on the Mozilla
                    Developer Network, or MDN (<a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">https://developer.mozilla.org</a>).</p>
                <p>If you would like to store a value into the variable, you can do so on the same line by using the
                    following syntax,</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> variableName = some value here;</code></pre>
                <p>where "some value here" could be a string, number, or object.</p>
                <p>You can declare and assign variables on separate lines as well. Use the following syntax.</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> variableName;<br>variableName = some value here;</code></pre>
                <p>This syntax works in the same way as the single line declaration and assignment seen above.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that in JavaScript, variables are case-sensitive. This means variables named "message",
                    "Message", and "MESSAGE" could all represent different things. Also, since JavaScript is a
                    loosely-typed language, variables can be assigned any type of data with one general statement.</p>
                <h2 id="Variables, Functions, Objects, and the DOM_Functions">Data Types</h2>
                <p>
                    Variables can store all sorts of information like numbers, text, or a collection of different
                    values. Every variable has an associated "data type" based on the kind of information that is stored
                    inside the variable. In JavaScipt, there are eight basic data types, but today we will only be
                    looking at the two most commonly used ones: Numbers and Strings.
                </p>
                <h3>Numbers</h3>
                <p>The Number data type in JavaScript is used to store integers and decimal numbers. Variables with this
                    data type can also be used to carry out math operations.</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> num1 = 15;<br><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> num2 = num1 / 3.7;</code></pre>
                <h3>Strings</h3>
                <p>The String data type in JavaScript is used to store text, which can be a combination of letters,
                    numbers and special characters. All strings need to be enclosed in single or double quotes.</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> city = "Madison";<br><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> name = 'Jeff';</code></pre>

                <h2 id="Functions_Functions">Functions</h2>
                <p>Functions in JavaScript are used to reduce redundancy in your code. It is a good idea to follow the
                    DRY (don't repeat yourself) programming principle when writing JavaScript. This means that any
                    duplicated JavaScript code should probably be put into a function. Wherever you use that code, you
                    may call that function.</p>
                <p>A common way to create a function in JavaScript can be done using the following syntax.</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> myFunctionName()<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"></span></span>{<br>  <span class="hljs-comment">// repeatable code goes here!</span><br><span class="hljs-comment">}</span></code></pre>
                <p> If you want to call the function we declared above, use the following syntax.</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs">myFunctionName();</code></pre>
                <p>Call the function wherever you need to repeat the code that is inside of the function declaration.
                </p>
                <p>There is another way to declare functions in JavaScript using the following syntax. However, in the
                    exercises in this class, we will only use the declaration shown before for our functions.</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myFunctionName = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function()</span></span>{<br>  <span class="hljs-comment">// repeatable code goes here!</span><br><span class="hljs-comment">};</span></code></pre>
                    <p>Declaring a function like this has some minor changes that we won't go into, but they are called in functionally identical ways.</p>
                <p>"function" is a keyword in JavaScript and always has to be used when declaring a function. You may
                    add arguments to the function declaration between the parenthesis, and you may also return values   
                    from the function. Below is an example function declaration and function call that takes two
                    numbers, adds them together, and stores them in a variable named "result".</p>
                <pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> addNumbers(num1, num2)<span class="hljs-function"></span>{<br>  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> num1+num2;<br>}<br><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> result = addNumbers(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">5</span>);</code></pre>
                <p>In this example, "result" should hold the integer 9.</p>

                </ol>
                <p>There are some functions that are defined already in the Javascript file, but for now you don't
                    need
                    to know how those work. We will be learning how functions work after this project. For this
                    project
                    we only to focus on the variables. </p>
                <h2>Step 1: Check if the webpage is working</h2>
                <p>Next, we will check if the webpage is working or not. This basic webpage takes in two numbers as
                    input and prints out the sum of those numbers. We will see if the button works or not.</p>

                        <p>This is the syntax for an HTML comment. HTML comments are useful to mark important areas

                        <p>This is called external linking, and it allows us to write JavaScript code in a separate
                            file
                            (saved with a .js extension). We can then execute JavaScript anywhere in our HTML file
                            by
                            linking to the external JavaScript file.</p>

                </ol>
                <p>You might notice that although the button works now, it doesn't print the correct output. There
                    are
                    some errors in our JavaScript file! Let's check out the JavaScript file and try to debug the
                    errors
                    using the console.</p>
                <h2>Step 2: Debug the errors</h2>
                <p>Next we will try to understand why the webpage prints out the wrong answer. We will try different
                    inputs and look at the outputs to make an educated guess, and then confirm that by using the
                    console.</p>
                <h3>Finding the error</h3>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            First we will try to understand why the webpage prints out the wrong answer. Enter
                            different
                            inputs into the text boxes and look at the outputs, and then try to guess what might be
                            wrong with the code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Hint: Try to enter text into the boxes instead of numbers and look at the output.</i>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You might have figured out by now what the error is. The JavaScipt code is treating the
                            numbers as text or "strings", and adding those strings together (also known as
                            concatenation) and printing the result. We will use the console to confirm if this is
                            the
                            error.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            To confirm if the error is JavaScipt treating the numbers as strings, we will print out
                            the
                            data type of the variables that store the numbers to the console. To do that, we will
                            use
                            the "typeof" operator. Open the "debug.js" file and go to line number 20. Then create a
                            new
                            line after that to write the following code.
                        <pre><code class="hljs php">console.log(typeof num1)</code></pre>
                        Do the same for "num2" and "sum".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Save the "debug.js" file and refresh the "index.html" webpage. Now open the JavaScript
                            console
                            in your browser.</p>
                        <p>Remember, on a Mac, use <strong>command-option-J</strong> to open the JavaScript console.
                            On
                            Windows, use <strong>control-shift-J</strong>.</p>
                        <p>
                            Enter any two numbers in the text boxes and press the button. You should now see the
                            data
                            type of the variable printed onto the console. The console prints out "string" for all
                            three
                            variables, which confirms that JavaScript is treating the numbers as strings.
                        </p>

                        <h2>parseInt() function in JavaScript</h2>
                        <p>
                            The parseInt() function takes in a string of numbers and converts it into an integer,
                            which
                            allows us to use all the math operations on the number.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Now that we know what the error is, we can fix it by modifying the code so that
                            JavaScript
                            treats the numbers we input as integers. To do that, we will use the parseInt()
                            function.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Open the "debug.js" file and go to line 20, where num1 and num2 are being added and the
                            result is being stored in sum. Replace the line with the following code:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs php">let sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            What this does is convert num1 and num2 to integers before adding them, and the correct
                            sum
                            is then stored in the variable "sum".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Save the "debug.js" file and refresh the "index.html" webpage in your browser. Enter any
                            two
                            numbers in the text boxes and press the button. You should now see the correct sum
                            printed

                <h1 class="no-top-margin" id="Variables, Functions, Objects, and the DOM">Functions, Objects,
                    and the DOM</h1>

                <h2 id="Variables, Functions, Objects, and the DOM_Variable Scope">Variable Scope</h2>
                <p>Variables in JavaScript have functional scoping. Scoping is a concept that describes where declared
                    variables can be "seen". If you declare a variable at the top of a script file, it can be "seen" and
                    used throughout the whole script. This is known as a "Gobal Variable". If you declare a variable
                    within a function, it can only be seen and used within that function. This is known as a "local
                    variable". This can be problematic sometimes because it is possible to accidentally write new values
                    to existing variables.</p>
                <p>Just be sure that whenever you declare a variable, you always use the "let" keyword. This will reduce
                    errors in your code. Also, a good rule of thumb is to declare any variables that you will use
                    throughout the whole script at the top of your JavaScript file, and declare any variables that you
                    will use within certain functions at the top of the function declaration.</p>
                <h2 id="Variables, Functions, Objects, and the DOM_Objects">Objects</h2>
                <p>Objects in JavaScript represent something that has properties and methods. You can think of an
                    object
                    like a car. Properties of a car would be make, model, year, and more. Some methods that the car
                    would have could be drive, play radio, lock doors, and more. We use objects in JavaScript and
                    other
                    languages. Some common objects in JavaScript are the Math object, Date object, and most
                    importantly,
                    the Window object. Documentation on these objects can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network,
                    or
                    MDN (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">https://developer.mozilla.org</a>).</p>
                <h2 id="Variables, Functions, Objects, and the DOM_Document Object Model (DOM)">Document Object
                    Model
                    (DOM)</h2>
                <p>The DOM is a web Application Programming Interface (API) that allows access to and modification
                    of
                    the current HTML document being displayed. You can think of the DOM as a virtual representation
                    of
                    the entire web page, including the browser that the HTML is being viewed in.</p>

                    alt="A Visual representation of the structure of the DOM, or Document Object Model">
                <p>The DOM contains the following objects.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Document:</strong> A representation of the HTML source that allows JavaScript to
                            dynamically edit any aspect of a web page. The <span class="type-text">write()</span>
                            function that we used previously is a part of the document object (remember how we used
                            <span class="type-text">document.write()</span> to make things appear in the page?).
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Window:</strong> A representation of the instance of the browser window. It can
                            be
                            used to move, re size, or otherwise affect the entire browser window. The <span
                                class="type-text">alert()</span> function is a part of the window object. The
                            Document
                            object is a property of the Window object and can be accessed by typing <span
                                class="type-text">Window.document</span>. It is usually shortened to just <span
                                class="type-text">document</span>, however.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Navigator:</strong> A representation of the specific browser program used to view
                            the
                            web page. It contains information like the browser's name, version, language, and other
                            properties.</p>

                    We are going to create a small, functional webpage to apply some of the concepts that we have learnt
                    so far. To do that, we will make a Tip Calculator. It will be a simple webpage that will take the
                    bill amount and tip percentage, and display the tip amount as an alert.
                </p>

                    <div class="sidebar-note">
                        <h2>Attaching External JavaScript</h2>
                        <p>Link to your external JavaScript either in the head or the body of your document. If you want
                            to run your JavaScript after your page is fully loaded, link to your JavaScript file right
                            before the closing body tag.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li>
                        <p>Try Clicking on the buttons on your web page.</p>
                        <p>None of the buttons are working! This is because we did not link our "index.html" file with
                            our "app.js" file. Let's do that now.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Navigate back to your file window.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Open "index.html" in a text editor of your choice.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Scroll Down towards the bottom of the HTML document. There should be an area that says:</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- external JavaScript link goes here --&gt;</span></code></pre>
                        <p>This is the syntax for an HTML comment. HTML comments are useful to mark important areas in
                            your HTML document, and are not executed by the browser.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Type the following directly below the comment.</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"js/app.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
                        <p>This is another way of linking to a JavaScript file, called external linking. We can write
                            JavaScript code in a separate file (saved with a .js extension), and then we can execute
                            JavaScript anywhere in our HTML file by linking to the external JavaScript file. This is
                            usually more readable than internal scripting that we saw earlier in the course.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Save the "index.html" file, and Open it in Google Chrome.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>You might notice that the buttons don't work. That's because we haven't added the code to make those
                    buttons do anything. Let's go back to the JavaScript file and fix that.</p>

                <h2>Linking HTML Elements to JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    The DOM object has two types of methods we can use to link HTML elements to JavaScript. The first
                    method is "getElementById". To get the HTML element using this method we need to pass in the "id" of
                    the particular element that we want as an argument to the function. Here is an example of
                    getElementById:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> incompleteTasksHolder = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">"incomplete-tasks"</span>);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here, we are getting the HTML element with id="incomplete-tasks", and storing it in the variable
                    "incompleteTasksHolder" so that we can reference it later in the JavaScript file. The other DOM
                    method that we can use to access HTML elements in JavaScript is "querySelector". The difference
                    between getElementById and querySelector is the getElementById uses the element's id to retrieve it,
                    while querySelector uses a CSS selector, which is useful for getting multiple elements of the same
                    type. You can also get elements by their id using this method. Here is an example of querySelector:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> incompleteTasksHolder = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.querySelector(<span class="hljs-string">'#incomplete-tasks'</span>);</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This is doing exactly the same thing as getElementById, the only difference here is the syntax. When
                    using the querySelector method to get an element by id, the id has to be prefixed with a "#". For
                    this webpage, we will be using both the methods.
                </p>

                <h3>Calculate Button Variable</h3>
                <p>The previous "Uncaught ReferenceError" you saw in the console can be fixed by a simple assignment of
                    a variable.</p>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Open the "js" folder.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Open "app.js" in the text editor of your choice.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the window.onLoad function, right below the comment that says declare the variable for the
                            calculate button, type the following code:</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> calculateButton = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">"calculate"</span>);</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Save the file "app.js".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Right-click "index.html" and Open With Google Chrome to view the changes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Try and click the Calculate button on the webpage. You will now notice that we get another
                            Uncaught ReferenceError, but this time the error message is different. We need to add some
                            functionality to the calculateTip function to fix this error.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    In the code you wrote above, we created a variable named calculateButton and stored the
                    &lt;button&gt; element object into the variable. We used the DOM to access this HTML element, by
                    getting the element from the document with the id of "calculate". Check out the HTML code for the
                    web application, and you will see that the &lt;button&gt; element has an id="calculate".
                </p>
                <h2>Completing the calculateTip Function</h2>
                <p>
                    We need to write the code for what happens when we click the "Calculate" button after entering the
                    values. The function has also been declared and there is some skeleton code provided. We need to
                    write code to get all the values from the text boxes and the drop-down list, calculate the tip and
                    then print it to the webpage.
                </p>
                <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Scroll down to the "calculateTip" function. It should be right below the comment that says
                            "complete this function"</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Find the comment that says "assign values of variables".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Below the comment, declare variables to store the respective values in them using
                            the "getElementById" method. The IDs for the HTML elements are in the comment. Use the same
                            name for the variables as the ID of the HTML element, as those variables are later used in
                            the code to calculate the tip. The first one is given as an example below:</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> amount = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">"amount"</span>).value;</code></pre>
                        <p>Note the ".value" at the end of the statement. This is used to get the integer value, which
                            is required to do integer arithmetic like basic math operations using the variables. Do the
                            same for the other two HTML elements.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Save the file "app.js".</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
                <p>We would want to calculate the tip amount only if some value has been inputted for the Bill Amount
                    and the type of service (tip percentage) has been selected from the drop-down list. If either of the
                    two inputs are empty, and the user clicks the Calculate button, we would like to alert the user and
                    tell them to input both values. This issue can be solved with conditional statements.</p>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Inside of the calculateTip function, add an if-else statement just below the comment that
                            says "add if else block here". Make your code look similar to the code below.</p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (amount === <span class="hljs-string">""</span> || service === <span class="hljs-string">'Select'</span>) {<br>   alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter valid values"</span>); <br>}<br><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {<br>    <br>}</code></pre>
                        <p>If the user does not input both the required values, the code will enter the if statement.
                            It will then show an alert asking the user to input valid values. If the input is valid the
                            code will enter the else statement. We'll add code the else statement to calculate the tip
                            amout and display it next. This is called control flow in programming.
                            Documentation on control flow can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network, or MDN (<a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">https://developer.mozilla.org</a>).</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Open "index.html" in Google Chrome, and see if the alert works.</p>

                </ol>
                <h3>Calculating and Displaying the Tip Amount</h3>
                <p>
                    We added an if else block that checks if the user entered a valid input. Our webpage displays an
                    error when valid input is not detected, but does not do anything when valid input is detected. We
                    need to add code to calculate the tip amount and display it when the user enters valid input.
                </p>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>
                        <p>Scroll down to the else statement in the if else block we just added.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Within the else statement, declare a new variable named "total" and store the tip amount to
                            be paid by each person in the variable. The tip can be calculated by multiplying the
                            amount by the service, and then dividing that by persons. The next step is to fix the
                            tip amount upto two digits of decimal. This can be done by using the "toFixed" method. as
                            demonstrated below: </p>
                        <pre><code class="hljs javascript">total = total.toFixed(<span class="hljs-string">2</span>);</code></pre>
                        <p>This method takes in only one parameter, which is the number of digits of decimal that you
                            want. In this case, two digits of decimal are enough. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, we need to display the tip amount on the HTML webpage. We will do this by using the
                        querySelector method. Add the following two lines of code after the total tip calculation inside
                        the else statement:
                        <pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">document.</span>querySelector(<span class="hljs-string">'.tip'</span>).style.display = <span class="hljs-string">'block'</span>;<br><span class="hljs-built_in">document.</span>querySelector(<span class="hljs-string">'#total'</span>).innerHTML = total;</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            The first line of code here is setting the visibility for the HTML element with class="tip",
                            which was previously not visible. This is done by getting the HTML element using the
                            querySelector method that we discussed earlier, and changing the CSS properties of the
                            element in JavaScript. The second line of code is assigning the value stored in the variable
                            total to the element with id="total". Note the difference in the syntax for the
                            querySelector method in the two statements. The first line has a "." prefix while the second
                            line has a "#" prefix. The "." prefix is used to get elements by their class, whereas the
                            "#" prefix is used to get the elements using their id.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Save the file "app.js".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Open "index.html" in Google Chrome, and view the changes.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>If the "Calculate" button is pressed without entering the valid input, then our web
                    application should display an alert. If valid input is entered, and the "Calculate" button is
                    pressed, it should display the tip amount to be paid by each person.</p>

                <p>This completes our Tip Calculator web application. Hopefully, this real life example gave you a
                    better idea of what JavaScript can do to a web page. It adds interactivity, and really enhances the
                    user experience. If you are still feeling confused about anything relating to JavaScript, feel free
                    to check out the documentation attached to the end of this manual. Once again, a good online
                    reference is the Mozilla Developer Network, or MDN (<a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">https://developer.mozilla.org</a>). It is very uncommon
                    for a JavaScript developer to write an entire script without having to look something up or use
                    documentation or some sort of reference. Do not be ashamed of simply doing a web search if you are
                    stuck on a certain part while writing your code, also.</p>

                    individual
                    tags include:</p>
                <table>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Function</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>innerHTML</td>
                            <td>Sets the text of textual tags</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>src</td>
                            <td>Sets the source URL for image tags</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>href</td>
                            <td>Sets the hyper reference for links</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>className</td>
                            <td>Sets the CSS class of the tag</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>style.color</td>
                            <td>Sets the CSS foreground color of the tag</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>style.backgroundColor</td>
                            <td>Sets the CSS background color of the tag</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>Most of the other CSS properties follow the same pattern as <span class="type-text">color</span>
                    and
                    <span class="type-text">backgroundColor</span>, namely that the properties are "camel-case"
                    meaning
                    that the first word is all lower-case and each successive word starts with an upper case letter.
                    Also, more specific tags (like lists, tables and other higher-order formattings) include
                    specialized
                    function to easily add list items or table rows.

                <p>The most common JavaScript events help trigger segments of JavaScript code on specified user
                    actions.
                    Here are a few of the most common events:</p>

                <h1 class="no-top-margin" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>From the exercises and material covered in this class, you should have a pretty good idea of the
                    capabilities and limitations associated with JavaScript. Keep in mind a couple of key points:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>JavaScript is most useful to create dynamic effects on a website</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>JavaScript can be turned off, so don’t require its use for any feature on your website
                            (especially form validation). Sometimes this is referred to as progressive enhancement,
                            if
                            you are looking for further information about it on the web.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Great references for JavaScript can be found online, specifically the Mozilla Developer
                            Network, or MDN (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">https://developer.mozilla.org</a>)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="Conclusion_Next Steps">Next Steps</h2>
                <p>Now that you have some experience with JavaScript, there are many other STS classes to look into:
                </p>
                <h3>JavaScript 2: jQuery and AJAX</h3>
                <p>This class expands on the topics covered in JavaScript 1 to introduce some pre-built JavaScript
                    packages that make the creation of professional-looking effects much easier. In this class you
                    will
                    work to create effects like expanding/collapsing menus, clicking-and-dragging effects, and
                    immersive
                    user interactions called AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML).</p>
                <h3>PHP/SQL in a Day</h3>
                <p>This class covers everything about PHP and SQL used for server-side programming in web pages. It
                    is a
                    good idea to get a general knowledge of both client-side, and server-side languages.</p>
